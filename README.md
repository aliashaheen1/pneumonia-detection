Description:

Welcome to our GitHub repository for Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Ray Images. In this project, we have leveraged a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, which is organized into three essential folders: 'train,' 'test,' and 'val.' Within these folders, you will find subcategories representing two critical image categories: 'Pneumonia' and 'Normal.' The dataset comprises a total of 5,863 high-quality X-Ray images in JPEG format, capturing the presence or absence of pneumonia in the patient's lungs.

These chest X-ray images, obtained from the retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged one to five years, were generously provided by the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center in Guangzhou, China. These images were not captured for the sole purpose of this study but were an integral part of the patients' routine clinical care.

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our AI-based pneumonia detection system, we embarked on a meticulous process of data curation and expert validation. Every chest radiograph underwent a stringent quality control screening, which resulted in the removal of low-quality or unreadable scans, guaranteeing that only high-quality images were used for analysis.

The diagnosis of each image was carried out by not one, but two expert physicians to minimize the possibility of grading errors. Only after a consensus between these experts was reached, were the images cleared for training our AI system. Furthermore, in an additional layer of quality assurance, an evaluation set was independently reviewed by a third expert to validate the accuracy of the diagnoses made by the primary experts.

Our AI model demonstrates impressive performance, with a testing accuracy of 97% and a training accuracy of 93%. These high accuracy rates underscore the robustness and effectiveness of our pneumonia detection system. We invite you to explore our repository, delve into the dataset, and understand the methodologies and algorithms employed in this endeavor.
